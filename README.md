## Priessnitz

Priessnitz is a free UCI chess engine. It does not include its own graphical interface but any UCI compatible GUI (e.g., [Cute Chess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess), [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de/)) will work.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Priessnitz started near the end of 2022. After watching [Sebastian Lague's Chess Coding Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk), I was motivated to
experiment with chess programming myself and soon entered the rabbit hole...

The name is inspired by a small local stream. Nothing deep, I just thought, it sounded nice.

## Building

You can build Priessnitz using the gcc compiler by running
```
make
```

## Appreciation
Without the amazing [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) and numerous open source engines,
most importantly [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master), [Ethereal](https://github.com/AndyGrant/Ethereal/tree/master), 
[Pirarucu](https://github.com/ratosh/pirarucu) and [Blunder](https://github.com/deanmchris/blunder/tree/main),
Priessnitz would not exist.
